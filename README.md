# LUSAS-Lookup
The Lusas Lookup Module is a Windows Forms application providing a user interface to access and manage geometric and database objects within a Lusas model. It allows users to view, filter, and interact with database members such as volumes, surfaces, lines, points, attributes, analyses, loadsets, and groups through a tree-view structure, alongside a detailed properties and methods viewer.
